Generates the first order regular perturnation on gamma (FPR) approximate solution to the Manakov equation considering the following scenarios:
1. Numerically computed or integral kernels
2. Geometrically constained integral kernels
3. Optimized kernels using Normalized Bacth Gradient Descent (NBGD)
